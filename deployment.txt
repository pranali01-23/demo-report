If you want to structure a basic React application without involving Node.js or Docker in the CI/CD workflow, you will primarily focus on the application's source files and the GitHub Actions workflow for deployment. Below, I’ll provide an example of the project structure, updated files, and a simplified GitHub Actions configuration for deploying a React app to GitHub Pages.

Updated Project Structure
Here's how your React project might be structured:

CopyReplit
my-react-app/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src/
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── index.js
│   └── ...
├── package.json
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── deploy.yml
Example package.json
This package.json file includes dependency management and a build script for your React app:

CopyReplit
{
  "name": "my-react-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "homepage": "https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": [
      "react-app",
      "react-app/jest"
    ]
  },
  "browserslist": {
    "production": [
      ">0.2%",
      "not dead",
      "not op_mini all"
    ],
    "development": [
      "last 1 chrome version",
      "last 1 firefox version",
      "last 1 safari version"
    ]
  }
}
Example deploy.yml
This is the GitHub Actions deploy.yml configuration file to build and deploy to GitHub Pages:

CopyReplit
name: CI/CD Pipeline for React App

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Listen for pushes to the main branch

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'  # Specify Node.js version

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build React app
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./build
          publish_branch: gh-pages  # Change this if you want a different branch for deployment
Explanation of the Files
package.json:

Homepage: This should be set to your GitHub Pages URL format. Replace <your-github-username> and <your-repo-name> accordingly.
Dependencies: The necessary React dependencies are included.
deploy.yml:

This workflow is triggered on pushes to the main branch.
It checks out the code, sets up Node.js, installs the dependencies, builds the React application, and then deploys the built app to GitHub Pages.
Important Notes
GitHub Pages: After the build pipeline runs successfully, the React app will be deployed to the gh-pages branch, making it available at the specified GitHub Pages URL.

No Node.js in Production: While Node.js is used during the CI/CD process for building the app, it is not required for running the React app on GitHub Pages or in production.

GitHub Actions Secrets: This setup assumes that you have GitHub Pages enabled and set up with the required access.

This simplified configuration eliminates unnecessary complexities and focuses directly on building and deploying a React app using GitHub Actions. If you have any further questions or need additional help, feel free to ask!
